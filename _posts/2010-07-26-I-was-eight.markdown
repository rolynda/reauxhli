![8 year old Roly](/img/embeddedpics/IMG_20140522_193300.jpg =500x)

I woke up that day to my sister’s worried eyes pretending to be asleep. I didn’t
know what was happening, but I knew that I had to pretend I was asleep too. I
made really slow movements and searched for her hand or leg, anything under
the blanket we shared to let her know I was awake and ready for a command.

It was her forearm I found. Her eyes shot open, worried and tired, giving me the
signal that the best thing to do was stay quiet and asleep.

I didn’t know what was worrying her so much, but I had a strange feeling in my
stomach. A creeping feeling on the back of my neck. Sickening and
scary. Someone was in our room, watching us sleep. He was waiting for us to
wake up.

I knew who it was instantly. He’d been finding his way into our house all summer.
Telling our little brothers that he was supposed to be watching us. That our
parents had asked him to come in and check on us sometimes. My little brothers
were awake before my sister and I on most days, unknowingly, they kept letting
him in. He'd play with them for a while, tell them he had to use the bathroom, and
made his way to my parent's room instead of theirs.

The "public" restroom in our house was in my brothers' room. It was right next to
the living room, and the only logical restroom to go to. The second bathroom was
in our parent's room. He used this excuse to walk down the hall to the room my
sister and I shared.

Sometimes we’d wake up to him watching us sleeping. Sometimes he’d be
outside trying to talk my two little brothers into something stupid and reckless, like
making a homemade bomb. Most of the time, however, he’d make his way to our
house early on summer mornings. Not too early that my parents were still there,
but not too late that we were awake yet. He’d make his way into the house, and
wait for my sister and I to wake up, all so that he could “talk” to us in our parent’s
room.

We didn’t talk, usually we couldn’t. He’d put his hand over our mouths and try to
touch us. It didn’t help that the floor in my parent’s room was uneven and hard to
walk on, much less run away. Usually, he’d just get a twist in my arm trying to drop
me to the bed, then I would kick him, or step on his foot, or stomp on his anything,
just to get away. Usually it worked, sometimes, well...

I don’t remember much about what happened when I didn’t get away.

For some reason, I didn’t tell much of anybody. This was the year that I started
wearing a sweater religiously everywhere, for fear that the bruises would show
and I’d have to talk about something I had failed at. It went on until I was around


Yeah, sure, eventually I told my mother.


It was really late on a friday night, I remember because my dad was nowhere to
be seen. Friday is his drinking night, with my uncle. His father. I told my mom what
had happened for me to loathe my fathers side of the family. What was haunting
me and keeping me away from people. I sat on the bed and spilled my heart out,
everything, all the guts I had left pulling me along.

She just said that I should’ve told her a lot earlier. I was fifteen now and it was too
late. What did I want her to do about it now, I’d have to get over it and try to cope.

I got a smile on my face the day that he broke both his knees running away from
the school security guards. I kept picturing him falling on his face, unable to get
up. I imagined him lying there, mostly helpless, and I walking up to him and
kicking him so hard in the middle of his face, hard enough to break something
else, and then leaving him there, 
you know, 
to try and cope.
